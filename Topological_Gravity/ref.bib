  abstract = {This note aims to provide an entr{\textbackslash}'ee to two developments in two-dimensional topological gravity -- that is, intersection theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces -- that have not yet become well-known among physicists. A little over a decade ago, Mirzakhani discovered {\textbackslash}cite\{M1,M2\} an elegant new proof of the formulas that result from the relationship between topological gravity and matrix models of two-dimensional gravity. Here we will give a very partial introduction to that work, which hopefully will also serve as a modest tribute to the memory of a brilliant mathematical pioneer. More recently, Pandharipande, Solomon, and Tessler {\textbackslash}cite\{PST\} (with further developments in {\textbackslash}cite\{Tes,BT,STa\}) generalized intersection theory on moduli space to the case of Riemann surfaces with boundary, leading to generalizations of the familiar KdV and Virasoro formulas. Though the existence of such a generalization appears natural from the matrix model viewpoint -- it corresponds to adding vector degrees of freedom to the matrix model -- constructing this generalization is not straightforward. We will give some idea of the unexpected way that the difficulties were resolved.},

Since our formalism naturally generalizes to higher-genus Riemann surfaces, we obtain the critical exponents for all genera. The corresponding results for the supersymmetric case are presented.

We discuss the saddle point approximation for these models, including a class of related O(n) matrix models. For d {$<$} 1 matter, the matrix problem can be completely solved in many cases by the introduction of suitable orthogonal polynomials. Alternatively, in the continuum limit the orthogonal polynomial method can be shown to be equivalent to the construction of representations of the canonical commutation relations in terms of differential operators. In the case of pure gravity or discrete Ising-like matter, the sum over topologies is reduced to the solution of nonlinear differential equations (the Painlev{\'e} equation in the pure gravity case) which can be shown to follow from an action principle. In the case of pure gravity and more generally all unitary models, the perturbation theory is not Borel summable and therefore alone does not define a unique solution. In the non-Borel summable case, the matrix model does not define the sum over topologies beyond perturbation theory. We also review the computation of correlation functions directly in the continuum formulation of matter coupled to 2D gravity, and compare with the matrix model results. Finally, we review the relation between matrix models and topological gravity, and as well the relation to intersection theory of the moduli space of punctured Riemann surfaces.},
