  abstract = {It is known that the adjoint representation of any Kac-Moody algebra               A               can be identified with a subquotient of a certain Fock space representation constructed from the root lattice of               A               . I define a product on the whole of the Fock space that restricts to the Lie algebra product on this subquotient. This product (together with a infinite number of other products) is constructed using a generalization of vertex operators. I also construct an integral form for the universal enveloping algebra of any Kac-Moody algebra that can be used to define Kac-Moody groups over finite fields, some new irreducible integrable representations, and a sort of affinization of any Kac-Moody algebra. The ``Moonshine'' representation of the Monster constructed by Frenkel and others also has products like the ones constructed for Kac-Moody algebras, one of which extends the Griess product on the 196884-dimensional piece to the whole representation.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive introduction to two-dimensional conformal field theory is given. The structure of the meromorphic subtheory is described in detail, and a number of examples are presented explicitly. Standard constructions such as the coset and the orbifold construction are explained. The concept of a representation of the meromorphic theory is introduced, and the role of Zhu's algebra in classifying highest weight representations is elucidated. The fusion product of two representations and the corresponding fusion rules are defined, and Verlinde's formula is explained. Finally, higher correlation functions are considered, and the polynomial relations of Moore and Seiberg and the quantum group structure of chiral conformal field theory are discussed. The treatment is relatively general and also allows for a description of less well known classes of theories such as logarithmic conformal field theories.},

Their proof was difficult and attempts to generalise it to the other affine algebras failed -- in hindsight the reason is that their argument ignored most of the rich mathematical structure present. We give here the "modern" proof of their result; it is an order of magnitude simpler and shorter, and much of it has already been extended to all other affine algebras. We conclude with some remarks on the A-D-E pattern appearing in this and other RCFT classifications.},

  abstract = {The SU(3) modular invariant partition functions were first classified in ref. [ 1 ]. Here we accomplish the SU(3) classification using only the most basic facts: modular invariance; E Z{\textasciitilde} and Moo = 1 (in [ I ], the Moore-Seiberg naturality "theorem" for partition functions was also used). A number of significant simplifications to the general argument are included here. Hidden in [ 1 ] were a number of smaller results which could be of independent value. These are explicity mentioned here. We also include a survey of known tools for WZW classifications, and sketch the beginnings of a program for classifying all WZW partition functions for any affine algebra g - indeed the proof here has been designed specifically to suggest this generalization.},

  abstract = {The problem of finding all possible effective field theories for the quantum Hall effect is closely related to the problem of classifying all possible modular invariant partition functions for the algebra u(1){$\oplus$}m, as was argued recently by Cappelli and Zemba. This latter problem is also a natural one from the perspective of conformal field theory. In this paper we completely solve this problem, expressing the answer in terms of self-dual lattices, or equivalently, rational points on the dual Grassmannian Gm,m(R){$\ast$}. We also find all modular invariant partition functions for affine su(2) {$\oplus$} u(1){$\oplus$}m, from which we obtain the classification of all N = 2 superconformal minimal models. The `A-D-E classification' of these, though often quoted in the literature, turns out to be a very coarse-grained one: e.g. associated with the names E6, E7, E8, respectively, are precisely 20, 30, 24 different partition functions. As a by-product of our analysis, we find that the list of modular invariants for su(2) lengthens surprisingly little when commutation with T --- i.e. invariance under {$\tau$} {$\rightarrow$} {$\tau$} + 1 --- is ignored: the other conditions are far more essential.},
