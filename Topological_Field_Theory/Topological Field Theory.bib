  abstract = {We develop techniques to compute higher loop string amplitudes for twistedN=2 theories with{\^c}=3 (i.e. the critical case). An important ingredient is the discovery of an anomaly at every genus in decoupling of BRST trivial states, captured to all orders by a master anomaly equation. In a particular realization of theN=2 theories, the resulting string field theory is equivalent to a topological theory in six dimensions, the Kodaira-Spencer theory, which may be viewed as the closed string analog of the Chern-Simons theory. Using the mirror map this leads to computation of the `number' of holomorphic curves of higher genus curves in Calabi-Yau manifolds. It is shown that topological amplitudes can also be reinterpreted as computing corrections to superpotential terms appearing in the effective 4d theory resulting from compactification of standard 10d superstrings on the correspondingN=2 theory. Relations withc=1 strings are also pointed out.},

This allows one to understand (oriented, closed) 1- and 2-dimensional TQFTs in terms of a finite amount of algebraic data, while already the 3-dimensional case needs an infinite amount of data. We evade these complications by instead discussing some aspects of 3-dimensional extended TQFTs, and their relation to braided monoidal categories.},

One of the               novel               observations of our present investigation is the existence of some kinds of restrictions in the case of our present St{\"u}ckelberg-modified version of the 2D Proca theory which is               not               like the standard Curci-Ferrari (CF) condition of a non-Abelian 1-form gauge theory. Some kinds of similarities and a few differences between               them               have been pointed out in our present investigation. To establish the sanctity of the above off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetries, we derive               them               by using our               newly               proposed (anti-)chiral superfield formalism where a few               specific               and appropriate sets of invariant quantities play a decisive role. We express the (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST conserved charges in terms of the superfields that are obtained after the applications of (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST invariant restrictions and prove their off-shell nilpotency and absolute anticommutativity properties, too. Finally, we make some comments on (i) the novelty of our restrictions/obstructions and (ii) the physics behind the negative kinetic term associated with the pseudoscalar field of our present theory.},

Here we will give a very partial introduction to that work, which hopefully will also serve as a modest tribute to the memory of a brilliant mathematical pioneer. More recently, Pandharipande, Solomon, and Tessler {\textbackslash}cite\{PST\} (with further developments in {\textbackslash}cite\{Tes,BT,STa\}) generalized intersection theory on moduli space to the case of Riemann surfaces with boundary, leading to generalizations of the familiar KdV and Virasoro formulas. Though the existence of such a generalization appears natural from the matrix model viewpoint -- it corresponds to adding vector degrees of freedom to the matrix model -- constructing this generalization is not straightforward. We will give some idea of the unexpected way that the difficulties were resolved.},

In this paper, we propose the LG/CY correspondence conjecture for \$tt{\textasciicircum}*\$ geometry and obtain the following result. Let \$f{\textbackslash}in{\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}[z\_0, {\textbackslash}dots, z\_\{n+2\}]\$ be a nondegenerate homogeneous polynomialof degree \$n+2\$, then it defines a Calabi-Yau model represented by a Calabi-Yau hypersurface \$X\_f\$ in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{CP\}{\textasciicircum}\{n+1\}\$ or a Landau-Ginzburg model represented by a hypersurface singularity \$({\textbackslash}mathbb\{C\}{\textasciicircum}\{n+2\}, f)\$, both can be written as a \$tt{\textasciicircum}*\$ structure. We proved that there exists a \$tt{\textasciicircum}*\$ substructure on Landau-Ginzburg side, which should correspond to the \$tt{\textasciicircum}*\$ structure from variation of Hodge structures in Calabi-Yau side. We build the isomorphism of almost all structures in \$tt{\textasciicircum}*\$ geometries between these two models except the isomorphism between real structures.},

We discuss the saddle point approximation for these models, including a class of related O(n) matrix models. For d {$<$} 1 matter, the matrix problem can be completely solved in many cases by the introduction of suitable orthogonal polynomials. Alternatively, in the continuum limit the orthogonal polynomial method can be shown to be equivalent to the construction of representations of the canonical commutation relations in terms of differential operators. In the case of pure gravity or discrete Ising-like matter, the sum over topologies is reduced to the solution of nonlinear differential equations (the Painlev{\'e} equation in the pure gravity case) which can be shown to follow from an action principle. In the case of pure gravity and more generally all unitary models, the perturbation theory is not Borel summable and therefore alone does not define a unique solution. In the non-Borel summable case, the matrix model does not define the sum over topologies beyond perturbation theory. We also review the computation of correlation functions directly in the continuum formulation of matter coupled to 2D gravity, and compare with the matrix model results. Finally, we review the relation between matrix models and topological gravity, and as well the relation to intersection theory of the moduli space of punctured Riemann surfaces.},

In our paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of two period integrals on the LG's side. Based on this analysis, we modify the real structure proposed by Cecotti on LG's side, and show that the aforementioned map is also preserved under the modified real structure. As a result, we establish full CY/LG correspondence for \$tt{\textasciicircum}*\$ structures.},

The main result is that this is a `perfect' functional provided due account is taken of its gauge symmetry. This enables topological conclusions to be drawn about the critical sets and leads eventually to information about the moduli space of algebraic bundles over the Riemann surface. This in turn depends on the interplay between the holomorphic and unitary structures, which is analysed in detail.},
